    <p> This specification defines a DID method (did:doge) that supports DIDs
        based on the public <a href="https://dogecoin.com/">Dogecoin</a>
        blockchain. Dogecoin is an open-source is a cryptocurrency,
        blockchain, and payment system that is instant, fun, and free from
        traditional banking fees.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <section>
  <h3>Prior Work and Enhancements</h3>
  <p> We draw heavily from groundbreaking prior work by Christopher Allen and
      Kim Hamilton Duffy within the W3C Credentials Community Group on the
      <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-btcr/">BTCR DID Method]</a> due
      to strong architectural similarities between the Bitcoin and Dogecoin
      blockchains.</p>
  <p> However, there are some key differences that enable new
      privacy-preserving benefits. Namely, the did:doge method-specific
      identifier is the Base58Check-encoded Dogecoin address itself, allowing
      for DID usage even in the absence of any public transaction histories
      and only relying upon them for rotation events for verification methods
      and service endpoints. This specification defines the efficient
      resolution of the did:doge method-specific identifier to an optional
      "genesis" TxRef for DID document updates, which then follows the linear
      transaction history "tip" in the same style of did:btcr.
  <p> In summary, while did:btcr requires a cleared transaction prior to
      first use, did:doge does not, allowing users use of decentralized
      identifiers even if they do not own cryptocurrencies.</p>

  <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
  <section>
  <h3>Doge DID Scheme</h3>
  <p> The namestring that shall identify this DID method is: <code>doge</code>.
      A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the prefix
      <code>did:doge</code>. As per the DID specification, this string MUST be
      in lowercase.</p>
  <p> The full Doge DID scheme is defined by the following
      <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/std68">ABNF</a>:</p>
  <pre><code>
doge-did    = "did:doge:" address
address     = "D" 33*33base58-char
base58-char = "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" / "8" / "9" /
              "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F" / "G" / "H" / "J" / "K" /
              "L" / "M" / "N" / "P" / "Q" / "R" / "S" / "T" / "U" / "V" /
              "W" / "X" / "Y" / "Z" /
              "a" / "b" / "c" / "d" / "e" / "f" / "g" / "h" / "i" / "j" /
              "k" / "m" / "n" / "o" / "p" / "q" / "r" / "s" / "t" / "u" /
              "v" / "w" / "x" / "y" / "z"
  </code></pre>
  <p> All Doge DID method-specific identifiers are Dogecoin addresses,
      which are Base58Check encoded P2PKH and P2SH prefixed by a
      <code>"D"</code>.</p>
  <p> Example Doge DID: <code>did:doge:DH5yaieqoZN36fDVciNyRueRGvGLR3mr7L</code>.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h3>Implicit Resolution</h3>
  <p> Every Dogecoin address, whether it has a transaction on the public
      Dogecoin blockchain or not, is a valid did:doge by default. If a
      Dogecoin address does not any did:doge genesis transactions, then a DID
      resolver MUST generate a default DID Document using the Dogecoin
      address as its only input into the following template, substituting the
      input for the placeholder <code>[DOGECOIN_ADDRESS]</code>:</p>
  <pre class='example'>
{
    "@context": ["https://w3id.org/did", "https://w3id.org/doge/v1"],
    "id": "did:doge:[DOGECOIN_ADDRESS]",
    "publicKey": [
       {
            "id": "did:doge:[DOGECOIN_ADDRESS]#wow",
            "controller": "did:btcr:[DOGECOIN_ADDRESS]",
            "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1RecoverySignature2020",
            "dogecoinAddress": "[DOGECOIN_ADDRESS]"
        },
        {
             "id": "did:doge:[DOGECOIN_ADDRESS]#vckey-0",
             "controller": "did:doge:[DOGECOIN_ADDRESS]",
             "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1RecoverySignature2020",
             "dogecoinAddress": "[DOGECOIN_ADDRESS]"
         }
    ],
    "authentication": ["#wow"],
    "assertionMethod": ["#vckey-0"]
}
  </pre>
  <p> A resolver MUST search the Dogecoin public blockchain exhaustively for
      did:doge genesis transactions as part of implicit resolution.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h3>did:doge Genesis Transactions</h3>
  <p> To initiate key and service input rotations, a did:doge DID controller
      MUST sign and clear a transaction to the public Dogecoin blockchain
      conforming to the following requirements.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The transaction MUST be signed by the private key corresponding to
        the did:doge method-specific identifier interpreted as a Dogecoin
        address (henceforth known as the "corresponding Dogecoin
        address").</li>
    <li>The transaction MUST contain in the <code>scriptPubKey</code> within
        the <code>txout</code> at index 0 a P2PKH Script with the
        corresponding Dogecoin address's <code>pubKeyHash</code> as the
        recipient, specifically by substituting the
        <code>publicKeyHash</code> for the placeholder
        <code>[DOGECOIN_ADDRESS_PKH]</code> in the Script template:
        <pre class='example'>
OP_DUP
  OP_HASH160
    [DOGECOIN_ADDRESS_PKH]
OP_EQUALVERIFY
OP_CHECKSIG
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>The transaction MUST contain in the <code>scriptPubKey</code> within
        the <code>txout</code> at index 1 the following Script exactly:
        <pre class='example'>
OP_RETURN 5468652054696d65732032372f4a616e2f32303231202744756d62204d6f6e657927204973206f6e2047616d6553746f70
        </pre>
        This unique value is meant to signify an intentful did:doge genesis
        transaction, and has been selected because it has not been used
        previously to this specification's existence.
    </li>
    <li>The transaction MUST NOT contain any other <code>txout</code> entries.</li>
  </ol>
  <p> The did:doge genesis transaction is defined as the transaction matching
      the criteria above found on the public Dogecoin blockchain with the
      lowest block height, and in the case of multiple matching transactions
      in the same block, the most preceding transaction in the transaction
      list.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h3>did:doge Update Transactions</h3>
  <p> To conduct key and service input rotations using did:doge update
      transactions for a DID, there must exist a corresponding did:doge genesis
      transaction as specified in the previous section.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The transaction MUST be signed by the private key corresponding to
        the <code>pubKeyHash</code> in the P2PKH Script recipient of the
        "tip" transaction of the corresponding DID's did:doge update
        transactions.</li>
    <li>The transaction MUST contain in the <code>scriptPubKey</code> within
        the <code>txout</code> at index 0 a P2PKH Script with the
        desired active private key's corresponding <code>pubKeyHash</code> as the
        recipient, specifically by substituting the <code>publicKeyHash</code>
        for the placeholder <code>[ACTIVE_KEY_PKH]</code> in the Script
        template:
        <pre class='example'>
OP_DUP
  OP_HASH160
    [ACTIVE_KEY_PKH]
OP_EQUALVERIFY
OP_CHECKSIG
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>To encode a single optional service endpoint URI, the transaction MAY
        contain in the <code>scriptPubKey</code> within the <code>txout</code>
        at index 1 the following Script template, substituing the desired
        service endpoint URI encoded as hex (no longer than 80 bytes) for
        <code>[SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URI]</code>:
        <pre class='example'>
OP_RETURN [SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URI]
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>The transaction MUST NOT contain any other <code>txout</code> entries.</li>
  </ol>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h3>Additional Terminology</h3>
  <p> The <dfn>following did:doge update transaction</dfn> with respect to a
      did:doge genesis transaction or did:doge update transaction is defined as
      the transaction on the public Dogecoin blockchain that uses the current
      transaction's <code>txout</code> at index 0 as its <code>txin</code> at
      index 0.</p>
  <p> The <dfn>terminal did:doge update transaction</dfn> is the terminal
      transaction obtained by starting at a did:doge genesis transaction or
      did:doge update transaction and recursively identifying the following
      did:doge update transaction until none exists.</p>
  <p> The <dfn>did:doge active keypair</dfn> is the corresponding keypair to
      the signature produced via private key signing of the terminal did:doge
      update transaction, or the corresponding keypair to the DID method
      specific identifier if no update transactions exist.</p>
  <p> The <dfn>did:doge active service endpoint</dfn> is the parameter of
      <code>OP_RETURN</code> in the <code>scriptPubKey</code> of the
      <code>txout</code> at index 1 of the terminal did:doge update
      transaction, or it is empty if no update transactions exist.</p>

    <h2>Operations</h2>
    <section>
    <h3>Create (Register)</h3>
    <p> Doge DIDs exist per each Dogecoin address by default.</p>
    <p> However, to enable key rotation and specification of a service
        endpoint, the following steps MUST be followed, using the placeholder
        <code>[DOGECOIN_ADDRESS]</code> for a Dogecoin address.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Ensure no valid did:doge genesis transactions exist.</li>
      <li>Construct a transaction with the following two <code>txout</code>
          entries only:
        <ol>
        <li>The <code>txout</code> at index 0 MUST contain within its
            <code>scriptPubKey</code> a P2PKH Script with the corresponding
            <code>[DOGECOIN_ADDRESS]</code> <code>publicKeyHash</code> as the
            recipient.</li>
        <li>The <code>txout</code> at index 1 MUST contain within its
            <code>scriptPubKey</code> the exact Script:
            <pre class="example">
OP_RETURN 5468652054696d65732032372f4a616e2f32303231202744756d62204d6f6e657927204973206f6e2047616d6553746f70
            </pre></li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Sign the transaction above with the corresponding private key for
          <code>[DOGECOIN_ADDRESS]</code> and clear it on the public Dogecoin
          blockchain.</li>
    </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
    <h3>Read (Resolve)</h3>
    <p> To resolve a did:doge DID, the following steps MUST be followed,
        using the placeholder <code>[DOGECOIN_ADDRESS]</code> for a Dogecoin
        address.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Search the public Dogecoin blockchain exhaustively for a did:doge
          genesis transaction as defined in Section 2.3.
      <li>If the did:doge genesis transaction does not exist, then resolve the
          DID document implicitly as specified in 2.2. At this point,
          resolution is considered to be completed and any additional steps
          below MUST NOT be followed.</li>
      <li>Construct a DID document substituting the Dodgecoin address
          corresponding to the did:doge active keypair (as defined in 2.5) for
          the placeholder <code>[DODGECOIN_ADDRESS]</code> in the template
          specified within 2.2.</li>
      <li>If the did:doge active service endpoint exists, define a single
          service endpoint within the DID document, populating the
          <code>id</code> with <code>did:doge:[DOGECOIN_ADDRESS]#service</code>,
          <code>type</code> with <code>DidDogeService</code>, and
          <code>serviceEndpoint</code> of the did:doge active service
          endpoint.</li>

    <h2>Security & Privacy</h2>
    <section>
    <h3>Security Considerations</h3>
    <p> DID method specifications MUST include their own Security
        Considerations sections. This section MUST consider all the
        requirements mentioned in section 5 of [RFC3552] (page 27) for the DID
        operations defined in the specification, including eavesdropping,
        replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and
        man-in-the-middle. Potential denial of service attacks MUST be
        identified as well.</p>

    <section>
    <h3>Privacy Considerations</h3>
    <p> DID method specifications MUST include their own Privacy Considerations
        sections to discuss any subsection of section 5 of [RFC6973] that could
